    <string name="bp_general_knowledge">The American Heart Association recommends home monitoring
        for all people with high blood pressure to help the healthcare provider determine
        whether treatments are working. Home monitoring (self-measured blood pressure)
        is not a substitute for regular visits to your physician. If you have been prescribed
        medication  to lower your blood pressure, don\'t stop taking your medication without
        consulting your doctor, even if your blood pressure readings are in the normal range during home monitoring.\n\n

Choosing a home blood pressure monitor\n\n
<b>The American Heart Association recommends an automatic, cuff-style, bicep (upper-arm) monitor.</b>\n\n

Wrist and finger monitors are not recommended because they yield less reliable readings.
Choose a monitor that has been validated. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.
When selecting a blood pressure monitor for a senior, pregnant woman or child, make sure it is validated for these conditions.
Make sure the cuff fits â€” measure around your upper arm and choose a monitor that comes with the correct size cuff.\n\n



<b>Blood pressure categories</b>
The five blood pressure ranges as recognized by the American Heart Association are:

<b>Normal blood pressure</b>\n\n
Congratulations on having blood pressure numbers that are within the normal
        (optimal) range of less than 120/80 mm Hg. Keep up the good work and
        stick with heart-healthy habits like following a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.\n\n

<b>Prehypertension (early stage high blood pressure)</b>\n\n
Prehypertension is when blood pressure is consistently ranging from 120-139/80-89 mm Hg.
        People with prehypertension are likely to develop high blood pressure unless steps are taken to control it.\n\n

<b>Hypertension Stage 1</b>\n\n
Hypertension Stage 1 is when blood pressure is consistently
        ranging from 140-159/90-99 mm Hg.
        At this stage of high blood pressure,
        doctors are likely to prescribe lifestyle
        changes and may consider adding blood pressure medication.\n\n

<b>Hypertension Stage 2</b>\n\n
Hypertension Stage 2 is when blood pressure is
        consistently ranging at levels greater than 160/100 mm Hg.
        At this stage of high blood pressure, doctors are likely to prescribe a
        combination of blood pressure medications along with lifestyle changes.\n\n

<b>Hypertensive crisis</b>\n\n

This is when high blood pressure requires emergency medical attention.
        If your blood pressure is higher than 180/110 mm Hg and you are NOT
        experiencing symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain,
        numbness/weakness, changes in vision or difficulty speaking, wait about five
        minutes and take it again. If the reading is still at or above that level,
        you should CALL 9-1-1 and get help immediately. Learn more about the two
        types of hypertensive crises.\n\n

    <string name="user_guide_details">Following is the way how to use Bpl Bp Monitor \n\n

   <br>1.Make sure cuff tube is securely connected to your blood pressure monitor.</br> \n\n

        <b>1.Make sure cuff tube is securely connected to your blood pressure monitor.</b> \n\n


        <b>2. Wrap Cuff around left arm and on elbow. Align artery mark and tubing to brachial artery
            (inner arm). Cuff fits most biceps 8.7-16.7</b> \n\n


        <b>3. Cuff should be snug but not too tight.You should be able to fit two fingers between cuff
        and an arm </b> \n\n


          <b>4. Push the power button and remain still during your measurement.
        and an arm </b> \n\n




        For optimal result with your Bpl Blood Pressure Monitor :  \n\n




    a.) Avoid eating, drinking alcohol, smoking, exercising, and bathing for
30 minutes prior to taking a measurement. Rest for at least 15
minutes prior to taking the measurement.\n\n

b.) Stress raises blood pressure. Avoid taking measurements during
stressful times. \n\n


c.) Measurements should be taken in a quiet place. \n\n

d.) Remove tight-fitting clothing from your arm.\n\n

e.) Sit on a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Rest your arm on
a table so that the cuff is at the same level as your heart.\n\n

f.) Remain still and do not talk during the measurement.\n

g.) Keep a record of your blood pressure and pulse readings for your
physician. A single measurement may not provide an accurate
indication of your true blood pressure. You need to take and record
several readings over a period of time. Try to measure your blood
pressure at about the same time each day for consistency\n\n\n
